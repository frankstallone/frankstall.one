In the world of digital interface design, there’s a big difference between feedback sessions designed for approval and those meant for genuine critique. Many teams have a ritual of design reviews as "sign-off" meetings with stakeholders—a process focused on securing approval before moving forward. But there’s a another type of design review, one that creates more refined, user-centered designs. This guide is for leaders and more senior individual contributors looking at design reviews to collaborate with similar disciplines, up level design related peers, and create a culture of iteration and openness. Let’s explore how structured critiques can elevate your team’s work, improve collaboration, and produce better products.

## Why peer-driven design reviews matter

While communicating design decisions to non-design stakeholders is important, there’s unique value in peer-driven critiques. By gathering product designers, content designers, researchers and other related design disciplines from across the organization together with design system team members, you bring diverse, specialized perspectives to the table. This approach builds better products and a stronger design culture, encouraging your team to evolve through shared insights and expertise.

## Creating a culture of iteration and openness

A strong culture of critique builds a safe space for feedback, where ideas can be openly shared and refined. When feedback is normalized, designers are more willing to explore and innovate without fear. This openness promotes not only individual growth but also helps the team speak a common language when discussing design decisions.

Cross-functional critiques, with contributions from product designers, researchers, content designers, and design systems bring well-rounded insights. Together, these perspectives align messaging, usability, and design into a cohesive experience that better serves users and business goals. With regular, structured reviews, iteration becomes the norm and innovation follows naturally.

## Structure and roles for a successful design review

Design critiques thrive on consistency. Establish a weekly review time that works for everyone, and keep the same group of five to seven contributors together for at least a quarter. Mixing design disciplines within each group, like product designers, content designers, researchers and someone from the design system team, creates a more balanced critique.

Define clear roles upfront to ensure a smooth process:

- **Facilitator:** A senior designer or lead to guide the session, keeping it on track.
- **Presenter:** The designer whose work is being reviewed.
- **Note-taker:** If desired, ask for a volunteer to take notes on behalf of the presenter. (Tools like AI transcription can help here too.)

Use a shared sign-up sheet linked in the meeting invite, and automate reminders to help people sign up a day or two ahead. Include essential details: date, name, link to the work, and key questions or feedback areas the presenter is focusing on. Having questions prepared in advance keeps discussions focused and minimizes tangents.

If possible, create a dedicated chat channel tied to each review group, and let team members pick a unique group name to build camaraderie. Consider starting each session with an icebreaker to loosen up the group—tools like ChatGPT can generate creative questions to kick things off.

## Framing the presentation with user stories and context

When it’s time for someone to present, context is key. Give presenters a few minutes to frame their design through user stories, goals, and what they’re hoping to accomplish. This focus helps the team empathize with users and guide their feedback.

Presenters don’t always need specific questions—they might be seeking general feedback to refine early concepts, share a work in progress presentation, or just want to see where the discussion leads. Allow flexibility, but keep feedback constructive and on track.

## Guidelines for giving and receiving feedback

Effective feedback is the heart of a productive design review. Here are some core guidelines for giving and receiving feedback:

### Giving feedback

- **Be specific and actionable:** Avoid vague comments. Instead of “This doesn’t feel right,” try “The hierarchy of the main action is deemphasized, which might make it hard for users to find.”
- **Frame feedback around user goals:** Anchor your feedback in user needs rather than personal preferences. Use statements like, “From the user’s perspective…” to keep feedback grounded and objective.
- **Ask questions instead of dictating solutions:** Encourage designers to think critically with open-ended questions, like, “What alternatives did you explore for this interaction?”
- **Balance positive and constructive feedback:** Recognize what’s working well, as well as areas to improve. Balanced feedback builds trust and keeps morale high.
- **Focus on the design, not the designer:** Frame your feedback on the design’s impact, not the designer’s choices, to maintain professionalism and encourage openness.

### Receiving feedback

- **Without defensiveness:** Avoid the instinct to defend your work. Listen actively, take notes, and give yourself time to process feedback.
- **Ask clarifying questions:** If something isn’t clear, ask follow-up questions, like “Could you clarify what you mean by ‘not intuitive’?”
- **Separate yourself from the work:** Remember, feedback is about the work, not you. This mindset shift makes it easier to accept constructive criticism.
- **Consider all feedback, but don’t act on everything:** Not every piece of feedback needs to be implemented. Use your judgment to prioritize changes that align with project goals and user needs.
- **Express appreciation:** Thank others for their input, even if it’s challenging to hear. Showing appreciation fosters a positive critique culture and encourages more honest feedback.

## Using design reviews as a learning and mentorship tool

Design critiques offer a great opportunity for professional growth and mentorship. For junior designers, they’re a safe space to practice articulating design decisions and learn from experienced team members. For senior contributors, reviews are a chance to guide less-experienced peers, sharing insights on design rationale, critical thinking, and best practices. This mentorship fosters a culture of growth and encourages a deeper understanding of design principles beyond aesthetics.

## Conclusion

Design reviews are a powerful addition to any design team’s process, offering a structured space for growth, collaboration, and innovation. With peer-driven critiques, teams build a culture where experimentation is encouraged, feedback is normalized, and ideas are refined with input from diverse perspectives. These reviews empower designers to think critically, articulate their decisions, and align their work with user needs, ultimately enhancing both individual skills and team cohesion.

Whether you’re a leader or a senior designer, establishing a thoughtful review process elevates the quality of your work, strengthens cross-functional relationships, and builds a unified design vision. By cultivating openness, structure, and empathy, design critiques become a key tool for professional growth and design excellence across the organization.
