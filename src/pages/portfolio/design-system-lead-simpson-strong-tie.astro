          <h2 class="mt-zero">Situation</h2>
          <p>
            When I joined Simpson Strong-Tie, the UX organization was facing
            significant challenges. The existing STUDS Design System had
            previously failed twice, creating internal skepticism and urgency.
            There were notable skill gaps within design and development teams,
            limited end-user and stakeholder engagement, and processes that
            lacked clarity and collaboration.

        <p>
          My role was to strategically relaunch and stabilize the STUDS Design
          System, close skill gaps across the teams, and implement operational
          processes to elevate the UX practice. Additionally, I aimed to foster
          a culture of continuous learning, collaboration, and strategic
          alignment to support the company's ambitious 2030 business goals.

            Conducted comprehensive listening tours with product teams and
            stakeholders to understand goals, constraints, and success metrics.

            Simpson Strong-Tie's digital transformation and modernization
            initiatives.

            Agile ceremonies introducing clear communication practices (weekly
            Loom videos and sprint reviews) to improve team consistency and
            quality. Contributed to the broader UX organization by creating
            Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), collaborated on restructuring
            weekly design reviews to improve transparency and cross-team
            alignment.
