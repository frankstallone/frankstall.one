        <h2 class="mt-zero">What I did for them</h2>
        <p>
          I spearheaded a comprehensive rebranding initiative, renaming the
          company, creating a new logo and branding style guide, and developing
          <a href="https://builderstrustcapital.com/" target="_blank"
            >a custom website</a
          > and marketing materials. This transformation was aimed at better communicating
          their values to both entrepreneurs and investors, aligning with their mission
          to facilitate growth and trust.

          <h2 class="mt-zero">The challenge</h2>
          <p>
            The challenge was to refresh the Ashmore Partners brand to one that
            deeply resonated with their target audience of entrepreneurs and
            investors, giving them an identity that showcased their values and
            stood out in the competitive financial space. My goal was to
            transform their existing brand into one that clearly conveyed their
            commitment to their client's success, across all physical and
            digital touch-points.

        >
          <h2 class="mt-zero">My approach</h2>
          <p>
            I began with deep dives into the company's ethos through group
            discovery sessions with the Ashmore Partners team. Knowing the aim
            was to realign their brand to connect with entrepreneurs and
            investors, it became clear that we'd need to choose a new name that
            better-embodied trust, stability, and transparency. Through detailed
            industry research and collaborative brainstorming, "Builders Trust
            Capital" was born &mdash; a name that perfectly mirrored its
            foundational principles.
          </p>
          <p>
            From there, we mapped out a plan to develop a fresh logo, a
            comprehensive style guide, and plans for all the physical and
            digital collateral we'd need to bring this new identity to life.

          <h2 class="mt-zero">The solution</h2>
          <p>
            In creating the new Builders Trust Capital identity, the solution
            needed to cover a lot of different touch-points. I started by
            collaborating closely with the team on developing a timeless logo
            that symbolized the renewed brand identity. This process was about
            creating a symbol that would stand the test of time across both
            digital and print mediums.

            In tandem, our copywriter began crafting a voice that captured the
            essence of Builders Trust Capital, interviewing clients and
            associates to ensure our messaging was authentic and engaging. This
            foundational work then led into the development of a full style
            guide that detailed our color schemes, typography, and layout
            principlesâ€”blending modern vibrancy with the traditional solidity
            expected in the financial sector.

            The digital transformation was next, grounded by a sharp,
            <a href="https://builderstrustcapital.com/" target="_blank"
              >user-friendly website</a
            > that was not only accessible but responsive across all devices. From
            wireframing in the browser to integrating live content for real-time
            feedback, I meticulously crafted each page to reflect the sophistication
            and clarity of the new brand. This ensured the site looked exceptional
            and gave a clean and elegant user experience for entrepreneurs and investors.
